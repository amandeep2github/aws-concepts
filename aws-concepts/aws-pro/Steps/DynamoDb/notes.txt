dynamo db doesn't support auto increment keys. as its expected to scale many partitions/shards/servers its considered
anti pattern.

one advice is to use UUID

update template to include local secondary index and global secondary index
create a backup
create join partition keys
global secondary index uses another storage so comes with its own read/write capacity units

Backup and TTL
